ARfitStudio is a plugin for EEGLAB developed by Makoto Miyakoshi and Tim Mullen. This plugins is developed to remove TMS-induced artifact, but can take care of any short-lasting spike or burst which is an artifact. It uses Matlab toolbox ARfit developed by Tapio Schneider and Arnold Neumaier to 'extend' the waves in the pre-spike window to replace the artifactual datapoints. The original solution was written by Tim Mullen. The dedicated Wiki page is linked here https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/ARfitStudio.
